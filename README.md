# CPlusPlus
C++ respository

The purpose of this project was to allow a user to calculate accrued interest and an end-balance for an investment account over a specified time period. 
This project was very well-documented and adhered to the four concepts of OOP well. The main function required bare minimum to code to operate the program, and class inheritance was solid.

Future enhancements to this code could include comprehensive exception handling and improved input validation. 

I found capturing an object and its member values at a set point in time to be the most challenging, a problem I solved through ‘snapshot.’ I have good friend who works for Lockheed Martin who offered that suggestion over a discord conversation. 

This project solidified my knowledge in building classes that inherit in a way that makes sense and focuses on the four OOP concepts.

I made this program maintainable, readable and adaptable by ensuring that the class structure was well-organized and documented. Any programmer should be able to sort through clearly stated comments that explain each class and function. Additionally, the master function allows a user to run this program with very minimal code in main, so adapting this program would only require tweaking the classes or creating a new class that inherits from already-built classes.
